Greetings, novice Trapfinder. The dangers you face in the Caverns will test your reflexes... and your nerve.

So you survived! Maybe you have what it takes after all. But you won't find the Dungeons so easy...

Impressive work, Trapfinder. Let's see what you make of the Marble Halls... or what they make of you.

Well, well. Not many Trapfinders make it this far. Don't let the Palace's fine trappings dull your senses!

Still alive, eh! I won't blame you if you turn back now. Few Trapfinders return from the Underworld.
